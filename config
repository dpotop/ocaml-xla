(lang dune 3.1)
; This is a dune global configuration file that tells dune
; two things:
; - to print all commands as it executes them
; - to use all the cores of the computer
; I should either place it in the global location (but on Mac
; I do not know it, or specified in the dune command as:
;   dune build --config-file ./config compiler/main.exe
; For more information:
;   https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html#config
; Compilation will still function without it, however. :)

; print all commands it executes 
; cf. https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dune-files.html
(display verbose)

; create as many jobs as there are cores
(jobs auto)
